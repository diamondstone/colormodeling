smj10.csv is taken from http://www.cvrl.org and based on Stockman, MacLeod & Johnson (1993) 10-deg cone fundamentals (for an equal energy spectrum). Columns are:
Wavelength (nm)
log L-cone spectral sensitivity
log M-cone spectral sensitivity
log S-cone spectral sensitivity

CIE_1931_transform.csv gives the coefficients for the RGB->XYZ transform in the CIE-1931 color space, taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space. The resulting vector should also be scaled by 1/b_{21}, where b_{21} is the {2, 1} component of the matrix (0.17697).
